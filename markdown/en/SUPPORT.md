# Supporting Matnbaz

Matnbaz is a useful and independent project that has great cultural value. It manifests the open-source contributions of Iranians to the world and is trying to promote the open-source culture to Iranians. It has also got a lot of love from the Iranian open-source community and has got a remarkable amount of GitHub stars and community members in a short amount of time.

Ever since [Nov 17, 2021](https://github.com/matnbaz/matnbaz/commit/501a75d79fa4ee66dbece238046daec838f4b356), The day we started Matnbaz, it has been under active development, requiring at least one dedicated developer to be working on it fulltime. We love working on Matnbaz but since it isn't a commercial project and the core developers of Matnbaz are students, we can't continue to work on it if we don't get financial support. Your support is crucial for Matnbaz to continue.
