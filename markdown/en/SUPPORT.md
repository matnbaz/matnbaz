# Supporting Matnbaz

We love working on Matnbaz but since it isn't a commercial project and the core maintainers of Matnbaz are students, we can't continue to work on it if we don't get financial support. Your support is crucial for the development of Matnbaz to continue.

Ever since [Nov 17, 2021](https://github.com/matnbaz/matnbaz/commit/501a75d79fa4ee66dbece238046daec838f4b356), The day we started Matnbaz, it has been under active development, requiring at least one dedicated developer to be working on it full-time.

You can learn more about Matnbaz in the [about page](https://matnbaz.net/en/about).

## Supporting As Companies

Companies can help Matnbaz by becoming an sponsor.

## Supporting As Individuals

Your biggest support is introducing Matnbaz to the others.

You could also do a one-time donation to Matnbaz. But please note that this, unlike supporting as companies, does not come with benefits.
