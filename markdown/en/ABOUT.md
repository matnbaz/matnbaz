# Initial Motive

The idea and motivation of the project came to us when we started to build and maintain an open-source package that we were sure would benefit many other people, but might not easily be findable. There are various repositories for collecting and showcasing Persian projects, but they are mostly limited and outdated. So we started thinking about automatically collecting Persian open-source repositories and eventually created Matnbaz. (Matnbaz means "open-source" in Persian and is pronounced |matn baaz|)

# Evolution of Matnbaz

After implementing the basic features like the explore page, Matnbaz received a lot of love from Persian developers. We also realized that there is quite a lot we can do with all the repositories and users, and new features, such as collections, selections, and the users chart were added to the project. As the Discord community grew, we also created a blog for the members to create content on.
